### Motivation:

- Since edge computing would be used in many field in the predictable future, this paper wanted to gain attention from the community and inspire more researches in this direction.

### Contribution(s):
- The paper discussed the necessarity of edge computing and gave the definition of it.
- The paper presented some possiblities of making use of edge computing as well as challenges to inspire other researchers.

### Approach:
- The researchers reviewed literature in the related fields to analyze the needs of the incoming IoT era on data processing.
- The researchers did some case studys to show where edge computing may shine in the future.
- The researches divided challenges and possiblities in to different categories when discussing them, giving a very clear structure for reading and understanding.

### Strengths:
- The researchers' vision were pretty broad and they hadÂ analyzed the application of edge computing in many fields.
- The review and analysis about the application of edge computing were very detailed and theoretically convincible.
- The case studies took some real life senarios into consideration and could really inspire some other researchers to work in those directions.

### Weaknesses:

- The paper proposed a lot of ideas and also a lot of problems, in a mixed style and was not easy for me to distinguish them from each other. If I were a researcher, I might be confused and felt not clear about what on earth was the problem needed to be resolved.
